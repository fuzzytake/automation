Introduction to CI/CD and Automation using [Buddy](https://buddy.works).

This is a demo repository, that I used when I created a screencast about automation.

Not much to see here **:(**.

## Installation

Nothing to install here.

This was just a demo repository [that I used in one of the screncasts](https://bytesized.tv).

There’s not much reusable stuff here at the moment **:(**.
